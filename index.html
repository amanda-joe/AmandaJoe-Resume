        <p class="lead mb-4">Vice President for 5 years.  Increase profit for company.  Youngest CEO to achieve consistently acheive fortune five hundred company.  Overachiever, University of Riverside.  Top five percent in my graduating class.  Graduated with honors.  I went to University of California for four years where I recieved my Masters in Business Administration.  I was a teacher's assistant where I underwent intensive job training and received a teacher's assistant award.  I graded papers and mentored students as well as providing feedback on all of their math worksheets.  I also lesson planned and assisted the professor in teaching undergrads business mathematics.  I hope to achieve greatness within my company and forsee imense expansion and growth in the next five years.  I hope to pursue a law degree in the next two years and I hope to become a lawyer.  I also help the community, by being a leader in the community, giving back to the commuity, coaching taekwondo on the side.  I have an imense passion for coding and hope to make that my side career as well.  Community leader, and I care about the environment. Another important thing I learned from this year is to put myself out there!  I am so proud of the people I have met this year, and I hope to keep growing my relationships with them in the years to come as well as making the best memories that I will remember after college.  Iâ€™ve found a church community on campus that I have become close with, and I consider these people my closest friends. College has been a time where I have had a chance to move away from home and learn to be independent and grow into the person I want to be.  That meant, first finding a church community to continue growing my faith, second putting myself out there and talking to new people as well as asking for help whenever I needed it, and third not being afraid to meet others and join new clubs and put myself out there.  Iâ€™ve grown so much since first starting college and my future goal is to keep striving to meet new people, experience new things, and continue to grow by continuously putting myself out there to grow and learn new things.  If it werenâ€™t for the experiences I went through with my roommate, the clubs Iâ€™ve become apart of, and the experiences I had here at the university of california in general, I would be the person I am today.  I probably would not have grown as much if I had just stayed back home and went to a community college.  I took a chance and put myself out into the world, and I want to continue to grow and change for the better.  The people here at the university of california riverside are amazing and I would not trade my college experience here for anything in the world.  Iâ€™ve gotten to live out some of my dreams here in college and I want to continue to keep pursuing them and pushing towards them!
